# Dissertation Requirements Compliance Check

## Summary

**Overall Status: ✅ Weeks 1–6 implemented and passing (48/48 tests), structurally aligned with
requirements — and, as of 2026-08-11, also verified against a real Mininet/OVS network, not just
the offline simulation (see §4a).** This banner originally read "100% ALIGNED" when Weeks 3–6 were
still placeholders (2026-07); see §"Final Verdict" at the bottom and
`results/reports/experiment_validation_report.md` for what that claim didn't cover at the time and
what's been verified against actual code since.

---

### D. Path Cost Function ✅

**Configuration**: [`config/decision.yaml`](file:///home/vboxuser/sdn-project/config/decision.yaml#L28-L33)

```yaml
path_cost_weights:
  alpha: 0.4    # Utilization weight
  beta: 0.3     # Delay weight
  gamma: 0.2    # Loss weight
  delta: 0.05   # Priority weight
  epsilon: 0.05 # Reliability weight
```

**Formula**: Cost = α·Utilization + β·Delay + γ·Loss + δ·Priority + ε·Reliability  
**Implementation Location**: [`src/decision/path_cost.py`](file:///home/vboxuser/sdn-project/src/decision/path_cost.py) — implemented and unit-tested (`tests/path_cost.py`, `results/decision_engine/path_cost_unit_tests.txt`)

**Known limitation (identified 2026-08-11, not fixed): no self-influence / offered-load accounting.**
Every edge's utilization term is the link's *currently observed* utilization
(`GraphBuilder._calculate_edge_cost`, fed by `NetworkState.get_link_stats()`) — i.e. what the link
looks like before this flow is placed on it. The cost model never adds the flow's own offered load
to a candidate path's projected utilization, so a candidate that looks cheap under background
traffic can still become congested once a large ("elephant") flow actually lands on it — the
decision can look correct at evaluation time and still under-perform once executed. This is a
genuine gap, not a simplification the code works around elsewhere: `grep` confirms no
`offered_load`/`residual`/`projected` accounting anywhere in `path_cost.py` or `graph_builder.py`.
Real traffic-engineering systems (e.g. MPLS-TE) typically address this with residual-bandwidth /
admission-control reservation, which this project does not implement — in scope, this project's
research question is *when to reroute and how to avoid instability*, not *capacity-aware placement
of a specific flow's demand*. Worth stating explicitly as a limitation/future-work item rather than
leaving it implicit.

**Known limitation (found 2026-08-12, delay unfixed / loss fixed): delay_ms and packet_loss had no
real data source anywhere in the monitor pipeline.** `grep -rn "delay_ms=" src/` returned zero
matches before this pass — nothing in `src/` ever assigned it a value; `StatisticsCollector.
aggregate_link_statistics()` (the function that builds `LinkStatistics` from real OVS data) never
passed `packet_loss` either, so both fields silently defaulted to `None`. `GraphBuilder.
_calculate_edge_cost()` treats `None` as `0.0`, meaning in a genuine live deployment (not the
offline simulation, which fabricates these values directly) **β and γ's terms would always evaluate
to zero** — utilization was the only signal actually driving routing decisions. Two different root
causes, two different outcomes:
- **packet_loss — fixed.** Real `ovs-ofctl dump-ports` output carries a `drop=` counter on both the
  rx and tx lines (confirmed against a live OVS bridge), which `parse_ovs_port_stats()` simply never
  parsed. Now parses it, and `StatisticsCollector.calculate_loss_rate()` (`tx_dropped /
  (tx_packets + tx_dropped)`) feeds a real loss rate into `aggregate_link_statistics()`. Covered by
  `tests/statistics_collector.py`.
- **delay_ms — still unfixed, harder problem.** Port byte/packet counters cannot yield a latency
  measurement; that needs a different mechanism entirely (active probing, e.g. periodic ping-based
  RTT, or in-band network telemetry), which doesn't exist anywhere in this project. Documented here
  as an open limitation rather than implemented, given the added complexity and system load risk of
  active probing infrastructure relative to this project's scope.

Separately, the *offline simulation's* `experiments/simulation_common.py::set_link_condition()` had
its own, independent version of this problem: every pilot scenario only ever passed `utilization=`
(never `delay_bump_ms`/`loss_bump`), so delay/loss stayed completely flat regardless of how
congested the simulated link became — unrealistic, since utilization/delay/loss are correlated
symptoms of the same congestion in a real network, not independent quantities. Fixed 2026-08-12:
delay/loss are now derived from current utilization via `congestion_delay_bump_ms()` (M/M/1-inspired
queueing delay, grows as `utilization/(1-utilization)`) and `congestion_loss_bump()` (near-zero below
70% utilization, then rises quadratically) — chosen, documented models, not universal laws.

**A consequence worth flagging explicitly: this makes the additive cost formula double-count the
same congestion signal.** Once delay and loss are functions of utilization, `∂cost/∂u = α +
β·(∂delay/∂u)/1000 + γ·(∂loss/∂u)`, not just α. Evaluated near u=0.9 at the current default weights:
0.4 (direct) + 0.24 (via delay) + 0.044 (via loss) = 0.684 total — utilization's real influence on
cost is ~1.7x the α term alone, because delay and loss are re-punishing the same underlying signal
they're derived from. This is a real form of multicollinearity in the cost formula, not fixed as
part of this pass (would require re-deriving the formula to weight residuals — the part of delay/loss
*not* explained by utilization — rather than raw values). Recorded here as a known, quantified
limitation for the same reason as the ones above: better to state it than leave it implicit.

## 4. Week-by-Week Task Verification

### Week 1: System Validation ✅ 100% Done
- [x] Topology verification — `experiment.py --stage 1` now actually loads
      `data/Geant2012.graphml` and computes node/link counts, connectivity, diameter, and average
      degree (previously `stage1()` just printed and wrote hardcoded strings; fixed 2026-08-09 via
      `experiments/topology_check.py`, which now owns this logic)
- [x] Connected nodes check
- [x] Alternative paths
- [x] Monitor module separation
- [x] Statistics model format
- [x] Integration complete

### Week 2: Network State ✅ 100% Done — `experiment.py --stage 2` now actually runs
`experiments/network_state_check.py` (rate calc, utilization, history window, link status,
`get_network_state()` interface, integration report) and produces every file
`README.md` promises, including `rate_validation.csv` which `stage2()` previously never generated at
all (it was a no-op — three `print()` lines and nothing else; fixed 2026-08-09, which now owns
this logic).
- [x] Real-time rate calculation
- [x] Link utilization mapping
- [x] Rolling history window
- [x] Link status detection
- [x] Network state interface
- [x] Integration complete

### Week 3: Baseline Routing ✅ Done
- [x] Graph builder / candidate paths
- [x] Static shortest path (deterministic)
- [x] Flow installer (real bidirectional OpenFlow-style rules)
- [x] Dynamic baseline (immediate reroute, now also reacts to link failure/recovery events)
- [x] Baseline comparison + repeated trials

### Week 4: Decision Engine ✅ Done
- [x] Threshold detection, persistence, path cost, minimum benefit, change budget, decision logging
- [x] Stage integration — `DecisionEngine` now actually combines hysteresis, hold-down, emergency
      failure bypass, and recovery-window switch-back (previously missing; fixed 2026-08-02)

### Week 5: Stability Control ✅ Done
- [x] Hysteresis, hold-down, emergency reroute, recovery protection, priority-aware policy
      (all individually validated in `results/stability/`)
- [x] Priority policy is now also wired into `DecisionEngine.evaluate_service_congestion()`
      and exercised end-to-end in Stage 6 (previously validated only in isolation; fixed 2026-08-02)

### Week 6: Result Pipeline ✅ Done
- [x] Traffic generator, metrics parser, repeated-run aggregation, full-system validation
- [x] All 4 scenario scripts (increasing load, congestion, failure/recovery, stale stats) now
      drive the real `src/routing`/`src/decision`/`src/stability` code against the real GEANT
      topology — previously every outcome was a hardcoded `if algorithm == X` branch; fixed 2026-08-02
- [x] Added `priority_policy.py` (Experiment E) to close the one Part-2 hypothesis
      (H-E2) that had no dedicated Stage 6 run

### Known open items (see `results/reports/experiment_validation_report.md`)
- `src/monitor/odl_client.py::get_port_statistics()` is still a stub (`return []`, even on a
  successful response) and isn't called anywhere in the current pipeline. This is **not a
  functional gap**: `StatisticsCollector.parse_ovs_port_stats()` already gets the same port/link
  traffic data directly from OVS (`ovs-ofctl dump-ports`) and is what actually feeds rate →
  utilization → `NetworkState` → path-cost-based routing. `ODLClient` is kept as a documented,
  intentionally-unfinished alternative (controller-mediated rather than OVS-direct) — decision
  made 2026-08-02: leave as-is, documented, rather than guess at ODL's RESTCONF schema without a
  live controller to verify against.
- `scripts/start_odl.sh` is an explicit placeholder — the real startup commands depend on
  which ODL distribution/version is installed on the actual testbed. This remains open: the
  project's actual chosen deployment path is direct OVS control (`ovs-ofctl`), not
  controller-mediated ODL, so this was deprioritized rather than fixed — see §4a.
- ~~T-001–T-004 (Mininet clean-startup, `pingall`, real rule-push checks) require the real
  testbed and have not been run in this (offline) environment.~~ **No longer accurate as of
  2026-08-11** — done against a real Mininet/OVS network; see §4a. The ODL-specific half of this
  item (an actual ODL controller instance) is still untested, consistent with the `ODLClient`
  decision above.

---

## 4a. Real Mininet/OVS Deployment Verification (2026-08-11, extends Week 6)

Everything above this section runs entirely offline (`NetworkState` seeded with synthetic
statistics, no real network ever built). This section covers the one piece that can't be verified
that way: whether the project's actual deployment mechanism — computing a path, then pushing it as
`ovs-ofctl` rules with no controller — works against a real running network at all. Two bugs
surfaced only once this was actually tried, neither visible from the offline simulation:

- **`FlowInstaller` switch/host naming didn't match `topology.py`'s real naming.** It guessed
  `s{node_id+1}`/`h{node_id+1}`; `topology.py` actually numbers switches/hosts by sorted *string*
  order of the GEANT graph's node IDs. These coincide only for single-digit node IDs — 38 of 40
  GEANT nodes were wrong. Fixed by adding an optional `node_mapping` parameter (backward-compatible;
  the guess formula remains the default since the offline simulation never checks these names
  against anything real). Regression-tested in `tests/flow_installer.py`.
- **The generated rule strings were never valid OpenFlow syntax.** e.g.
  `ovs-ofctl add-flow s13 priority=100,h13->h38,actions=output:s1` — `h13->h38` isn't a real match
  field, and `output:s1` needs a numeric port, not a switch name. This was always intentional as
  human-readable text for `dump_flows()`'s offline display, not something meant to be executed —
  but that intent was never documented, so it looked like a real (broken) deployment path.
  `scripts/mininet_path_verification.py` now does the real translation once a network is actually
  running: real port numbers queried live via `ovs-vsctl ... ofport`, real `nw_dst=<ip>` match
  fields, correct `-O OpenFlow13`.

A third issue was found and fixed during verification itself, not from reading code: switches were
first brought up with `failMode=standalone`, whose implicit table-miss action floods unmatched
traffic via plain L2 learning with no loop prevention. GEANT is cyclic (61 edges over 40 nodes),
so this caused a real broadcast storm (one switch's fallback rule processed 16 million packets in
about two minutes) — the likely root cause of an earlier session where system load forced a
reboot. Switched to `failMode=secure` (drops unmatched traffic by default), which also matches the
project's actual design better: no reliance on switch auto-learning, only explicit pushed rules.

**Results, both against the full real 40-switch `GeantTopology`:**

| Script | What it checks | Result |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `scripts/mininet_path_verification.py` | A `GraphBuilder`-computed path, translated to real OpenFlow rules and pushed with no controller, is actually followed by real ICMP traffic | 0% packet loss |
| `scripts/mininet_failure_recovery_demo.py` | A real link failure (Mininet interface brought down, not just a removed rule) is detected via `TopologyState.mark_link_failed`, `GraphBuilder` reroutes around it, stale rules are purged and replaced, traffic recovers, and the graph reflects the link's return once restored | 0% packet loss before failure, 0% after reroute, recomputed path after recovery == original path |

This closes the "does this actually deploy" question the offline simulation structurally can't
answer, without replacing the offline experiments — those remain the evidence for whether the
stability-aware algorithm itself performs well, which these two scripts don't re-test (see the
scripts' own docstrings for that distinction).

## 6. Check Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Research Questions | ✅ Covered | All Rq1-Rq3 |
| Traffic Classes | ✅ Exact | High/Medium/Low as specified |
| Scenarios | ✅ Exact | 4 scenarios + baseline |
| Stability Mechanisms | ✅ Exact | All 5 mechanisms configured |
| Parameter justification | ⚠️ Now measured, not optimal | Every threshold in `decision.yaml` was a fixed value set once at the first commit with no tuning process. Added `experiments/sensitivity_analysis.py` (real sweeps against `DecisionEngine`/`StabilityManager`) so the reaction-latency-vs-churn trade-off is measured, not asserted — see `results/reports/experiment_validation_report.md` §12. This does not claim the defaults are optimal, only that their cost is now known. |
| Cost Function | ✅ Exact | α-β-γ-δ-ε weights set |
| Baselines | ✅ Exact | Static + Dynamic |
| Metrics | ✅ Exact | All required |
| Project Structure | ✅ Cleaned up | `src/analysis/` and `src/traffic/` were empty scaffolding directories from the original 2026-07-18 skeleton, never populated (no `__init__.py`, nothing ever imported from them) — removed. The functionality those names implied already lives elsewhere: "traffic" in `experiments/traffic_generator.py` + `src/stability/traffic_policy.py`; "analysis" in the top-level `evaluation/` package. |
| Test coverage | ✅ Closed three gaps | Added `tests/decision_engine.py` (7 tests), `tests/calculate_metrics.py` (9 tests), and `tests/flow_installer.py` (4 tests, added 2026-08-11 after the real-deployment naming bug in §4a) — `DecisionEngine`, `evaluation/`, and `FlowInstaller` were previously only exercised indirectly, with no dedicated, fast, isolated unit tests despite every sibling module having one. 48/48 tests now passing. |
| Real deployment | ✅ Verified 2026-08-11 | Static path push and dynamic failure/recovery both confirmed against a real 40-switch Mininet/OVS network with no controller, 0% packet loss — see §4a. |

---

## Final Verdict

**✅ Weeks 1–6 are implemented and passing (48/48 tests), Stage 6's comparative
experiments are driven by the real routing/decision/stability code rather than
hardcoded outcomes, and — as of 2026-08-11 — the actual deployment mechanism (path
computation → real OpenFlow rule push, no controller) has been verified end to end
against a real 40-switch Mininet/OVS network, including a live link failure/recovery
run (§4a).** See `results/reports/experiment_validation_report.md` for the full
account of what was found broken/incomplete and fixed. Remaining open items are
ODL-specific (the `odl_client.py` stub and `scripts/start_odl.sh` — the project's
actual deployment path is direct OVS control, not controller-mediated ODL, so these
were deprioritized rather than fixed). This document was last verified against the
actual code on 2026-08-11 — treat any date after that as unverified.
